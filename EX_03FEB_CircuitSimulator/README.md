EX\_03FEB - Circuit simulator

Building a circuit simulator that uses logical gates. Complete the truth table calculator by setting the correct values for each combination of inputs.

* Start with the following input signals:

&nbsp;- signal\_A and signal\_B will take all possible combinations (true or false)

* Calculate these outputs according to truth tables:

 - output1: (A \&\& B)

 - output2: (A || B)

 - output3: (!A \&\& B)

 - output4: !(A || B)

 - output5: (!A || !B)
