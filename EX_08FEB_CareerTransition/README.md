EX\_08FEB - Career transition

Simulate a man's transition to a new career as a programmer by tracking the man's progress in learning programming concepts over a given number of days.

The logic is the following:

&nbsp;- Every day, the man writes 10 lines of code.

 - Every 3 days, the man learns a new concept.

 - If the day is divisible by 7, the man takes a break and doesn't code (use continue).

 - If the man has learned 5 concepts, they have a breakthrough and the learning process ends (use break).

The returned string must include the total lines of code written and the number of concepts learned.
