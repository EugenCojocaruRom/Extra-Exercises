EX\_07JAN\_Financial Simulation

John wants to open a deposit to a bank, and wonders in how many years he will accumulate a desired total amount, considering the interest added each year to his deposit.

&nbsp;- initialAmount - the initial amount added when creating the deposit

&nbsp;- interestRate: the yearly interest rate, as a percent; after each year, the yearly interest is computed based on this rate and the current deposit amount, and then this value is added to the deposit (increasing its current amount, for next year)

&nbsp;- targetAmount: the amount at which John wants to arrive.
