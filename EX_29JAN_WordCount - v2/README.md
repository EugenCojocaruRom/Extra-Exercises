EX\_29JAN - Sort and count words - v2

Receive a text (as a String) and:

 - split it into separate words (using spaces as separators) and return all words as a list (preserving their initial order, and including possible duplicates)

&nbsp;- return only the distinct words contained in the text, sorted alphabetically

&nbsp;- for each distinct word, it counts how many times it appears in text, and returns this info as a Map, where the keys are the words and the value is its usage counter

&nbsp;- sort the word-count pairs (see above) alphabetically by word
