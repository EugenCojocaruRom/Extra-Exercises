13FEB - Josephus problem
A number of N soldiers (named as 1..N) are standing in a circle, waiting to be executed.
Counting starts in one direction (ascending by their numbers) and every M-th is killed.
The last remaining one is spared. Which soldier remains the last one? (print the numbers of killed soldiers, in their elimination order, and the name/number of the remaining one)

&nbsp;- Print at each step some info like the current remaining list of soldiers and the number of the soldier chosen to be next

&nbsp;- Use a List to hold the numbers of remaining soldiers, but you need count correctly when reaching the end of list ('roll' your counter correctly over the list size limit)
