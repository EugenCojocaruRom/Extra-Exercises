15FEB - Josephus problem - using names instead of numbers
A number of N soldiers (with names) are standing in a circle, waiting to be executed.

Counting starts in one direction (in the order their names were entered) and every M-th is eliminated.

The last remaining one is spared. Which soldier remains the last one? (print the names of eliminated soldiers, in their elimination order, and the name of the remaining one)

\- Print at each step some info like the current remaining list of soldiers and the name of the soldier chosen to be next

\- Use a List to hold the names of remaining soldiers, but you need count correctly when reaching the end of list ('roll' your counter correctly over the list size limit)
