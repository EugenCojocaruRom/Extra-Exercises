Create a function named 'createFlavorMatrix' that receives 'mainIngredients' and 'seasonings' as its parameters.

Your task is to create a culinary flavor matrix by combining main ingredients with various seasonings. This matrix will represent unique flavor combinations.

The function should create and return a 2D array where each element is a combination of a main ingredient and a seasoning. Follow these steps:

&nbsp;- Create a 2D string array with dimensions: number of main ingredients × number of seasonings.

&nbsp;- Use nested loops to iterate through both input arrays.

&nbsp;- For each combination, concatenate the main ingredient with the seasoning, separated by a space and a plus sign.

&nbsp;- Store each combination in the corresponding cell of the 2D array.

Parameters:

&nbsp;- mainIngredients (String\[]): An array of strings representing the main ingredients.

&nbsp;- seasonings (String\[]): An array of strings representing the seasonings.

The function returns a 2D string array (String\[]\[]) representing the ingredients/flavors mix.
