HackerRank Exercise - 08-DEC-2025 - output formatting



Input Format



Every line of input will contain a String followed by an integer.

Each String will have a maximum of 10 alphabetic characters, and each integer will be in the inclusive range from 0 to 999.



Output Format



In each line of output there should be two columns:

* The first column contains the String and is left justified using exactly 15 characters.
* The second column contains the integer, expressed in exactly digits; if the original input has less than 3 digits, you must pad your output's leading digits with zeroes.
