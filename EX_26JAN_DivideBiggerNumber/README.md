EX\_26JAN - Divide the bigger number

Input 3 numbers: the first indicates how many times to do iterations, and the last two are numbers to do operations on.

Create a method that receives two arguments and returns the bigger number of the two (or one of them if equal).

At each iteration:

&nbsp;- Call the method with num1, num2, and save the result in a variable.

&nbsp;- Divide the bigger number of the two by 2, and then replace the original larger variable with the new result value.

&nbsp;- Print the new value.  

Continue doing it until no more iterations left or one of the numbers is smaller than 2.
